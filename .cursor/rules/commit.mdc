# Git Commit Rules

Create commits only when the user explicitly asks for it.

## Commit Message Format
Use Conventional Commits:
- `feat(scope): description`
- `fix(scope): description`
- `docs(scope): description`
- `refactor(scope): description`
- `chore(scope): description`

## Requirements Before Commit
1. Run `npm run lint`.
2. Stage only relevant files.
3. Keep commits atomic and focused on one logical change.

## Push Policy
- Never push without explicit user instruction.
