# Line Endings Policy

This repository uses LF line endings via `.gitattributes`.

## Required Defaults
- Keep `.gitattributes` with `* text=auto eol=lf`.
- Prefer repository-local `core.autocrlf=false` on Windows.

## If Lint Fails with CRLF Errors
1. Run `git config core.autocrlf false` in this repository.
2. Run `npm run lint:fix`.
3. Re-run `npm run lint` and verify no linebreak errors remain.

## Notes
- Do not switch project files to CRLF.
- Keep committed text files in LF to ensure stable pre-push checks.
