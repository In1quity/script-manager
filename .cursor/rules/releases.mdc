# Release Management Rules

Create releases only on explicit user request.

## Release Policy
- Do not create tags or releases automatically.
- Follow semantic versioning (`major.minor.patch`).
- Update version in `package.json` when requested.

## Release Steps
1. Ensure `npm run lint` passes.
2. Bump version (`npm version patch|minor|major`) when requested.
3. Push commits and tags only after explicit approval.
