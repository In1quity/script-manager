# Release Management Rules

Create releases only on explicit user request.

## Release Policy
- Do not create tags or releases automatically.
- Follow semantic versioning (`major.minor.patch`).
- Update version in `package.json` when requested.
- Prefer reproducible, automation-friendly release notes over manual one-liners.

## Release Steps
1. Ensure `npm run lint` passes.
2. Bump version (`npm version patch|minor|major`) when requested.
3. Push commits and tags only after explicit approval.
4. Ensure the GitHub Release body includes meaningful change notes:
   - If an annotated tag message exists and is detailed, it may be used.
   - Otherwise generate notes from PRs/commits between tags (e.g. GitHub auto-generated notes).
5. Verify release assets match built outputs in `dist/` (do not omit newly added public artifacts).
6. Confirm the release exists and is published, then provide the release URL.

## Modern Best Practices (for this repo)
- Keep Conventional Commits in release-related commits to improve note generation quality.
- Prefer draft-first release flow when release notes/assets may still need checks.
- Use `.github/release.yml` categories/exclusions if automated notes become noisy.
