# ESLint Auto-fix Rule

Run `npm run lint:fix` first when updating JS code or lint configuration in this repository.

## Priority Order
1. Run `npm run lint:fix`.
2. Fix remaining issues manually.
3. Run `npm run lint` and ensure there are no errors.

## Project Notes
- This project uses tabs for indentation.
- JS sources live in `src/` and `scr/`.
- Formatting is enforced by ESLint (`@stylistic`), not Prettier.
