# Git Safety Policy

Commit and push only after explicit user instruction.

## Allowed Actions
- Commit only when user asks to commit/save/push changes.
- Push only when user explicitly asks to push.

## Required Behavior
- Before commit/push tasks, follow `.cursor/rules/commit.mdc`.
- Never perform destructive git actions unless user explicitly requests them.
- Keep staged changes relevant to the requested task only.
